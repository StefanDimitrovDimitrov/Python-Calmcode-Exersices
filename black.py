"""

Black is the uncompromising Python code formatter.
By using it, you agree to cede control over minutiae of hand-formatting.
In return, Black gives you speed, determinism,
and freedom from pycodestyle nagging about formatting.
You will save time and mental energy for more important matters.

Installation
Black can be installed by running

        pip install black

It requires Python 3.6.0+ to run but you can reformat Python 2 code with it, too.
"""
"""
Usage
To get started right away with sensible defaults:

black {source_file_or_directory}
